    "## What are neural ionic currents?\n",
    "Neuronal membranes, like all cell membranes, are generally impermeable to charged ions. However, neuronal membranes have special proteins called ion channels embedded within them which allow certain types of ions to pass through. When these ion channels are present, ions are allowed to move across the membrane according to two driving forces: concentration gradient and charge gradient. Like all chemical species, ions will tend to move away from areas where they have a high concentration and towards areas of low concentration due to entropy. Additionally, ions will be repelled by areas of the same charge and attracted to areas of the opposite charge. Based on the charge of an ion and its typical concentration in physiological situations, one can determine the membrane voltage at which the push and pull from the concentration and charge gradients will equalize. This is called the \"reversal potential\" of that ion current, and it is the point to which the ion current would drive the cell if it were acting on its own. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ionic currents with reversal potentials above the cell's typical resting potential are \"depolarizing\" or \"excitatory\", and currents with reversal potentials below the typical resting potential are \"hyperpolarizing\" or \"inhibitory\". For more a detailed overview of this topic, see Greg Conradi Smith's [Cellular Biophysics and Modeling](https://doi.org/10.1017/9780511793905). Depending on the number of ion channels of each type present (dictating the membrane's *conductance* of each current), the neuron's voltage will tend to equilibrate at some value. \n",

    "## What is activity-dependent homeostatic plasticity (ADHP)\n",
    "It has been observed in various model systems that neurons which are chronically hypo- or hyper-active adjust their expression of various ion channels to restore target levels of excitation (Turrigiano et al., 1994). This process is thought to be dependent on intracellular Calcium concentration, which tracks activity level. As such, it is called activity-dependent homeostatic plasticity (ADHP). Putting aside the nonlinear properties of some ion channels which allow for complex neural behaviors like bursting, it makes logical sense that achieving such robustness would necessitate the following homeostatic rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyper-active neurons should downregulate their inward/excitatory conductances and upregulate their outward/inhibitory conductances. Hypo-active neurons should upregulate their inward/excitatory conductances and downregulate their outward/inhibitory ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, abstract models of ADHP proposed by O'Leary et al. (2013) have shown that other, more *counterintuitive* sets of rules can also confer robustness to certain perturbations. First, we will build some general intuitions about how ADHP works by trying to replicate this result using O'Leary et al.'s (2013) simple model. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Overview\n",
    "In addition to its Calcium conductance, the model neuron contains three abstract ionic conductances: $g_1$, $g_2$,and $g_3$. Each one allows ions to flow across the membrane through a different type of protein channel. These channels don't have complex non-linear dynamics, meaning they don't exhibit gating or inactivation periods, like some realistic ion channels do. Each one is simply governed by one reversal potential, $E_1$, $E_2$, and $E_3$, respectively. The reversal potentials of these currents are defined as: $E_1=-90$, $E_2=-30$, and $E_3=+50$. Because the contribution of Calcium to the membrane potential is ignored in this model, the membrane potential ($Vm$) is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    ">$C_m\\frac{dVm}{dt} = g_1(-90-V_m) + g_2(-30-V_m) + g_3(50-V_m)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $C_m = 1$ is the membrane capacitance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the authors' earlier experimental work, the Calcium concentration ($[Ca^{2+}]$)was modeled as a function of the membrane potential. Specifically, \n",
    "\n",
    ">$\\tau_{Ca}\\frac{d[Ca^{2+}]}{dt} = A e^{b Vm} - [Ca^{2+}]$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\tau_{Ca} = 100$ is the time constant of the Calcium conductance, and $A = 109.2$, $b = 0.08$ are experimentally determined model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, activity-dependent homeostatic plasticity (ADHP) occurs because the conductances themselves are changing as a function of the difference between the current Calcium concentration and the target Calcium concentration, $c_t$. For each of the three currents, $g_i$:\n",
    "\n",
    ">$\\tau_i\\frac{dg_i}{dt} = g_i([Ca^{2+}] - c_t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\tau_i$ is the time constant of that conductance value. \n",
    "\n",
    "**_Importantly, these $\\tau$'s determine in which direction and to what extent each conductance is affected by the distance from the target_**, which of course is the same for all conductances. A negative $\\tau_i$ dictates that the conductance is increased when $[Ca^{2+}]$ is **too low** and a positive value dictates that the conductance is increased when $[Ca^{2+}]$ is **too high**. Additionally, a small $\\tau_i$ indicates that that conductance is quickly and strongly responsive to Calcium changes, while a large tau dictates a slow and weak response. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the system of equations governing this model system is:\n",
    "\n",
    ">$C_m\\frac{dVm}{dt} = g_1(-90-V_m) + g_2(-30-V_m) + g_3(50-V_m)$\n",
    ">\n",
    ">$\\tau_{Ca}\\frac{d[Ca^{2+}]}{dt} = A e^{b Vm} - [Ca^{2+}]$\n",
    ">\n",
    ">$\\tau_1\\frac{dg_1}{dt} = g_1([Ca^{2+}] - c_t)$\n",
    ">\n",
    ">$\\tau_2\\frac{dg_2}{dt} = g_2([Ca^{2+}] - c_t)$\n",
    ">\n",

    "*Debrief:* Relatively strong correlation structure has emerged, though it doesn't differ much between conditions. It makes sense that the set of $\\tau_i$'s you pick should define a general direction of movement in conductance space, but why should that result in a correlation structure among the resulting solutions when the whole plane of equilibrium points is available? It seems like this may be a result of choosing initial conditions from a very small area of parameter space far away from the plane of equilibrium points, and when acted on by a direction of movement, these points spread out in a way that gave them correlational structure. Thus, it is **not anything specific about the ADHP rules that lead to this, but only the initial conditions.** We can test this hypothesis by asking if the same patterns emerge for a more spread-out cluster of initial points which is not so far away from the equilibrium plane\n",

    "## **Conclusion**: \n",
    "Through these modules, we have seen that multiple sets of rules governing activity-dependent homeostatic plasticity can lead hyper- or hypo-active neurons back to their target activity level. This includes rule sets that we wouldn't expect to be homeostatic, but because they still lead the neuron in a favorable direction in parameter space, they restore homeostasis. From a sample of initial points with a small variance, each ADHP mechanism yielded a distinct cluster of final solutions on the equilibrium plane. It has been hypothesized in the literature that these distinct correlation structures are the result of the unique homeostatic rules. However, when the variance of this sample was increased, the correlation structure disappears, with the end results of each ADHP mechanism being virtually indistinguishable. Thus, it is only the degeneracy of the parameter space, not the ADHP mechanism, which determines correlation structure of the final solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Future questions**:\n",
    "*   We have seen cases where a steady state is reached, but not at the correct calcium concentration. Are there initial conditions (especially in the flipped/anti-homeostatic case) where a steady state is not reached (or all conductances go to zero)? \n",
    "\n",
    "* Would noise in the system disrupt these results? \n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the basin of attraction of the $Ca^{2+}$ steady state plane, and how does it differ under different homeostatic rules?\n",
    "\n",
    "* What are some other measures that could be used to numerically demonstrate the difference between the small variance and large variance case? (Ideas include clustering algorithms, linear separability/machine learning, information theory, etc.)\n"
